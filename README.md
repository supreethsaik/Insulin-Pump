# Insulin-Pump
This is a compact non-invasive Insulin Pump modelled around the Medtronic Mini-Med 780G System.

**Overview:**
This project presents the design and prototyping of a modular, body-adherent insulin pump system aimed at improving patient mobility, comfort, and usability in diabetes management. The design integrates insulin delivery, glucose monitoring, and user control into a single compact wearable unit, reducing reliance on external tubing and invasive components.

**Problem Statement**
- Conventional insulin pumps often suffer from:
- Tethered designs that limit mobility
- Discomfort due to cannula-based CGM and infusion sets
- Bulky form factors requiring clothing support
- Reduced discretion during daily activities

These limitations negatively impact user compliance and quality of life.

**Proposed Solution**
A **sleek, modular, body-adherent insulin pump** inspired by the Medtronic MiniMed 780G, with key innovations:
- Fully integrated, adhesive-based wearable design
- Replacement of cannula-based CGM with a non-invasive optical glucose sensor
- Replacement of infusion set cannula with a microneedle array
- Touchscreen interface protected by a hinged screen flap
- Lightweight, compact geometry optimized for daily wear

**Overall device dimensions: 54 mm × 35 mm × 15 mm**

**Key Features**
- Modular, body-adherent architecture
- Improved mobility and discretion
- Reduced invasiveness
- Touchscreen-based control interface
- Designed for manufacturability and rapid prototyping
